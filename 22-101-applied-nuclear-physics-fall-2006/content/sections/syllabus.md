Description
-----------

22.101 is dedicated to foundational study of nuclear radiations - neutrons, gamma rays and charged particles and their interactions with matter. Of primary interest are the basic concepts of nuclear stability and reactive collision phenomena involving elementary quantum and classical mechanics, along with kinematics relations based on conservation laws. A signature focus is the understanding of cross sections and their use in various application areas relevant to the Department.
